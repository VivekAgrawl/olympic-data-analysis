# Unlocking Olympic Data: SQL Insights into Decades of Games

In this project, a dataset of 120 years of Olympics history was analyzed. The given dataset was cleaned and analyzed to mine informational insights using Python and MySQL.

### Project Description

The focus of this project was on analyzing the dataset of 120 years of Olympics history using SQL queries. The dataset consisted of two tables: "dataset_olympics.csv" and "noc_region.csv". The "dataset_olympics" table contained information about athletes, their teams, the Olympic Games they participated in, and the medals they won. The "noc_region" table was used to provide the mapping between the National Olympic Committee codes (NOC) and the corresponding regions. The dataset was cleaned using Python and Pandas to ensure data quality. In module 2, SQL queries were written to extract insights based on the given questions.
